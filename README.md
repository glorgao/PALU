## PALU: Concise Reasoning through Lagrangian Optimization

This repository hosts the code, W&B logs, and finetuned models for our paper [Concise Reasoning in the Lens of Lagrangian Optimization](). Our proposed algorithm, PALU (Performance-Aware Length Update), frames concise reasoning as a performance-constrained length reduction problem, optimizing for the shortest reasoning path that still meets a target accuracy.

### 🚀 Key Highlights

- ***65%*** shorter generations while achieving ***+15%*** accuracy improvements across ***five*** benchmark reasoning tasks (AIME24, Math 500, AMC 23, OlympiadBench and Minerva-Math).

- Cross-domain robustness across ***math***, ***logic***, and ***STEM*** tasks.

- Model-scale generalization: consistent performance from ***1.5B***, ***7B***, to ***14B*** parameter models.

- Built on ***Lagrangian optimization principles***, balancing reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

- Evaluated on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen model family.
